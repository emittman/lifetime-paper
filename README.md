# A hierarchical failure-time model for observational data exhibiting infant-mortality and wearout failure modes
- Chapter 4 of my dissertation: [https://dr.lib.iastate.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/42b94ef8-a562-4776-80b9-f0f59e000452/content]
- The focus is on modeling failure data across multiple populations with multimodality, often affected by truncation and censorship.
- Hierarchical modeling is used to borrow information across groups, enhancing uncertainty assessment and enabling full inference for groups with limited data.
- A hierarchical version of the generalized limited failure population model (Chan and Meeker, 1999) is introduced to address multimodality.
- The model is applied to a large dataset of lifetime information from over 75,000 hard drives across 44 different models.
- Flexibility of the Bayesian approach is demonstrated through posterior samples, utilizing Stan Development Team (2015) for model selection, assessment, estimation, and prediction.
